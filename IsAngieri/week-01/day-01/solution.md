#Jeremy Bowers is the perp
He has memberships in all for of the files: AAA, Delta_SkyMiles, Museum_of_Bash_History, AND Terminal_City_Library. I'm pissed because I tried a command (comm -1 -2 filename otherfilename) and it didn't show that bowers had memberships in all four, let alone any of them.

I think it has to do with this error looking thing:
comm: file 2 is not in sorted order
comm: file 1 is not in sorted order

#Realized that since the perp has a AAA and Delta card that if I compare the files AAA and Delta_SkyMiles for similarities, the perp's name should be the result. I got this:
comm -1 -2 AAA Delta_SkyMiles
comm: file 2 is not in sorted order

comm: file 1 is not in sorted order
Yu Sakaguchi

#Turns out Yu Sakaguchi is not the guy, its an 80 year old woman
Yu Sakaguchi	F	80	Rozella Street, line 281

#Still, may be important. I will next look up her Street in people file. these two showed up. I'll check their info against vehicles now to get their heights
#Checked on Keefe and he's not it
./interview-174898:1:The license plate of Keefe's Mazda matches the witness's description, but the make is wrong, and Keefe has never been a SkyMiles member.  Shouldn't be considered a suspect.

#Supposing that the CLUE about the perp's height is true, I'm going to geuss the perp is John Keefe. I will now check to see if Yu Sakaguchi also has a library card and a BASH Museum card, I should have done that awhile ago I guess.
Sakaguchi does have a Museum of Bash HIstory card, but doesn't have any of the other memberships. Dead end.
